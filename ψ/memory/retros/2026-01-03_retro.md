# Retrospective: Plugin Commands Metadata Update

**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Duration**: ~1 session

---

## What We Did

### ✅ Completed
1. **Added metadata headers to 11 commands**:
   - `focus.md` - Set task focus
   - `pause.md` - Pause work session
   - `note.md` - Quick note capture
   - `trick.md` - Save code tricks
   - `pattern.md` - Save reusable patterns
   - `delegate.md` - Delegate to agents
   - `breakdown.md` - Break down tasks
   - `lll.md` - Project status
   - `hours.md` - Work hours tracking
   - `trace.md` - Search everything
   - `start.md` - Start session

2. **Enhanced README.md**:
   - Added full workflow example (JWT auth scenario)
   - Added "Key Workflow Patterns" section

3. **Synced plugin files** to marketplace directory

## What We Learned

1. **Metadata Template**: All commands now use consistent YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: "Thai | English description"
   allowed-tools:
     - Tool1
     - Tool2
   ---
   ```

2. **Tool Authorization**: Different commands need different tools:
   - File operations → `Write`
   - Delegation → `Task`, `Bash`, `Read`
   - Searching → `Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`
   - Task breakdown → `TodoWrite`, `AskUserQuestion`

3. **Workflow Documentation**: Full example showing morning → lunch → end-of-day flow helps users understand how commands work together

---

## What Went Well

✅ Batch processing similar files (read all, edit all) was efficient
✅ Used TodoWrite to track progress through 13 tasks
✅ README workflow example shows real usage scenario

---

## What Could Be Better

⚠️ Some commands may need additional tools (e.g., `review.md`, `debug.md` not updated yet)
⚠️ The `.claude/commands/` and `.claude-plugin/` directories need to stay in sync

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Consider adding metadata to remaining commands (`review.md`, `debug.md` if they exist)
- [ ] Test all commands after marketplace release
- [ ] Update version in package.json for release
